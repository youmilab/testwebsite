This line of research focuses on developing and applying causal inference methods in educational settings, by integrating methodologies from quasi-experimental designs, machine learning, and multilevel modeling. Ongoing projects include:

- (1)	advancing regression discontinuity designs tailored to educational settings and integrating them with other quasi-experimental designs
- (2)	developing robust machine learning for causal inference in multilevel observational studies
           
These projects have been supported by an AERA Division D grant and an AERA-NSF grant for early-career scholars.
